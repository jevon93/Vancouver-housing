Web scraping Vancouver real estate data from Remax and analysing it

Currently the python file scrapes all of the property data for Vancouver houses for sale on the Remax.ca website and writes it to a CSV file.

I've included the CSV file for completion purposes.

I will be building upon this in coming days by further cleaning, analysing and visualising the data. I'd like to get an understanding of the distribution of house prices based on neighbourhoods and house sizes (beds/baths).

Code is still very basic. Next step is separating the beds/baths column in the written excel file and finding the neighbourhoods each home is located in so that we can analyse the distribution of house prices between different neighbourhoods based on number of bedrooms and baths. This could be done easily in excel but I will be writing it all in Python for a challenge. We can then do the analysis and visualisation. 

The number of pages is also hard-coded in. This could be improved.

I would also like to find data on square footage of each property somehow.
